# Quant Trading Interview Questions

Trading has always been a reach-goal for a lot of aspiring CS and Math majors in college.
In finance you're always on your feet for what comes next, and you get paid _a lot_.

Unfortunately, I have not really found any complete tutorials online for how to prepare
for quant trading interviews. My guess is that a lot of people who pass these interviews
already have the sufficient background for the task, and also that if these guides existed,
then people who weren't the super "talented ones" would already be saturating the highly-coveted
trading jobs and -- then trading would no longer be put on such a high pedestal.

But hey, I want more people to have opportunities, so here is my attempt to help you
give some of the biggest trading firms your best bet.

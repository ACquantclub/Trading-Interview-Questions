# Not so Technical

Trading is a very competitive and mentally/emotionally straining environment.
During the behavioral portion of interviews, firms really want to get an impression
of your personality, and see if you can survive in the boxing arena that is Wall Street.

## Questions

1. If you had $10 million, and didn't have to pay any of it back, but you were only allowed to keep any profits (i.e. if you end up with $10.4 million, you get to take home $400k, but if you end up with $5 mil, you take home nothing), what would you do if you had:
   - 3 days
   - 3 years
   - Also explain your reasoning for each scenario

2. If you have good grades, the firm will likely ask you why you do. Similarly, they will ask you what your motivations are in life.

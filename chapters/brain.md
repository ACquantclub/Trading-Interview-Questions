# Not Intuitive

Brain teasers are meant to confuse and frustrate you. A way to prepare for these type of questions is to
develop good problem solving skills. Another way is just to memorize enough and hope that you
get asked one of them.

- A rope is tied around the circumference of the Earth very tightly, so that it is tightly taut along
  the surface of the Earth. Now suppose that you add 1 feet of length to this rope, so that it is a bit
  looser. How high above the surface of the Earth will this new rope be?

- You have 1000 bottles of water, one of which is poisoned. You have a bunch of lab rats that you can 
  use to test the water and try to figure out which bottle is poisoned. Unfortunately, since the poison
  takes 24 hours to activate, and you must figure out the results in 24 hrs, you must feed all your rats
  now, and then wait the next day to see the results. How many rats do you have to use to figure out which
  bottle of water is poisoned?

# Not Intuitive

Brain teasers are meant to confuse and frustrate you. Often, what
interviewers are trying to do is emulate a test of how you think, using the
concept of Type I and II thinking from the book _Thinking Fast and Slow_. The
general gist of Type I and II is that Type I is the intuitive thinking
process and is quick, but may lead to mistakes, and Type II thinking is more
thorough, uses logic and math foundations, and gives you more accurate
answers, although they can take longer to formulate. In general, traders like
to see people think in Type II, and to be able to do it quickly.

A way to prepare for these type of questions is to develop good problem
solving skills. Another way is just to memorize enough and hope that you get
asked one of them.

- A rope is tied around the circumference of the Earth very tightly, so that it is tightly taut along
  the surface of the Earth. Now suppose that you add 1 feet of length to this rope, so that it is a bit
  looser. How high above the surface of the Earth will this new rope be?

- You have 1000 bottles of water, one of which is poisoned. You have a bunch of lab rats that you can
  use to test the water and try to figure out which bottle is poisoned. Unfortunately, since the poison
  takes 24 hours to activate, and you must figure out the results in 24 hrs, you must feed all your rats
  now, and then wait the next day to see the results. How many rats do you have to use to figure out which
  bottle of water is poisoned?

- You have a bag of 100 strings. You reach in the bag, grab two ends of
  strings, and tie them in a loop. You keep on doing this until there are no
  ends left. How many loops do you expect to end up with on average?
  
- There are 100 prisoners. There are 100 boxes with random numbers from 1-100 in them, one each. Each prisoner has a chance to go in the room and try to find their number. If they do so, they will make it out alive. Otherwise, they are killed on the spot. The prisoners are allowed to plan a strategy before they go in, but surviving prisoners will not be able to tell the other prisoners what they have seen. What is the best strategy for going about saving as many prisoners as possible, and how many prisoners can you save?

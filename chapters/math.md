# Be Quick

A prerequisite for most quant trading roles is to be able to think quickly, and thus, be able to do math quickly.
If you're someone who struggles to do basic math quickly -- it's gonna be a rough ride. But the good news is that 
no matter how bad you are, there is almost always room for improvement.

## Quick Maths

A good way to practice your basic arithmetic skills is to visit [zetamac](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/), which
prompts you simple math problems quickly. Your goal is to answer as many problems as you can quickly. Notice that
because they don't penalize you for inputting wrong answers, try to not guess your answers.

## Sequences and Patterns

Trading companies love testing your ability to know sequences. Some of these sequences are technically challenging,
requiring you to compute things. Other times, it's just knowing some phrase in English (sorry non-native speakers)

- 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, (Fibonacci)
- 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 (2^n)
- 1, 6, 21, 66 (3x_{n-1}+3)
- F, S, T, F, F, S, S, E, N, T (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...)
- M, V, E, M, J, S, U, N, P (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, ...)

There are many, so check out [sequences](./sequences.md) for more.

## Competition Math

If you don't know already, a lot of trading firms like to recruit from the competition math community.
These are people who have spent a good deal of their life training, and thinking through very hard problems
and answering them correctly in very high pressure, limited timed settings. Competition math
can be special to you doing math for these trading interviews because it not only teaches you tricks
to solve problems faster, but it also exposes ways to look at problems a different way and gives you
a huge toolbox to use for cracking seemingly unbreakable problems.

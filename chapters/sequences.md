# Sequences

A collection of sequences and some tips on how to identify them

## Techniques

A common "harder" sequence is something like

- 12, 29, 63, 131 (x_n = 2x_{n-1}+5)
- 75, 41, 27, 20 (subtract by 34/2^n, next number should be 16.5)

Try to look out for:

- Do the numbers look special themselves? (powers, squares)
- Differences between numbers
- Dependence of future numbers on numbers prior
- The "length" of the repeating subsequences
- The general trend of the size of numbers

## Number Sequences

- 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, (Fibonacci)
- 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 (2^n)
- 1, 6, 21, 66 (3x_{n-1}+3)

## Letter Sequences

These can be a little more challenging since they rely on your language skills a bit.
Memorizing some of these sequences should help you a long way though.

Also a lot of tests try to make these sequences harder by starting in the middle of them.
So for example, if we had the months, then they would start like `J, J, A, S, O` so it's
less obvious.

- A, C, E, G (skip a letter in the alphabet)
- P, Q, S, T, V (two consecutive letters, then skip one)
- F, S, T, F, F, S, S, E, N, T (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...)
- O, T, T, F, F, S, S, E (one, two, three, four, ...)
- M, V, E, M, J, S, U, N, P (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, ...)
- M, T, W, T, F, S, S (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday...)
- J, F, M, A, M, J (January, February, March, April)

# The Interview Process

The typical interview process will look something like this:

- __Take-Home Test__: This test is for you to complete on your own, and is to weed out people who don't qualify for the basic skills necessary to be a good trader. The following sections usually appear on these tests:

  - Lots of easy arithmetic problems to be done in a short period of time
  - Multiple choice or short answer about slightly harder probability and math questions
  - Game betting problem
  - Coding exercise

  Some advice for this test. As always, try to do as many problems as possible, as accurately as possible.
  But if you notice that you are stuck on a problem, move on.

- __Phone Interview__: Here, the interviewer gets learn a sense of how you think real time. They will ask you to solve probability and math questions on the spot. Make sure to guide them through your thinking process, but don't waste so much time that you don't have time to figure out the actual answer.

- __Onsite__: If you've made it here, congrats! You have already done a lot, so don't be upset if you don't do well here. The onsite will probably be the most stressful part of the interview process. Here, the firm wants to know if you can think fast, show excellent quant skills, and really perform well under lots of pressure.

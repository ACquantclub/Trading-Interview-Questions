## Headhunters

If you work in software, you will often be approached by headhunters who work in companies that try to earn money from successful referrals of candidates.
Their "talent search" is pretty much just picking people from FANG and then forcing them down a few pipelines for Quant or SWE in Trading.
There are often unethical practices here where they try to tell you as many questions as they can, based off of previous candidates' experience.
You can argue that even knowing the answer doesn't really guarantee you the job, since you might be asked throw-up questions or unexpected surprises that you can't prepare for, e.g. your working style or thinking process.
I think in general, it's not a terrible way to apply to firms, but it is a bit annoying knowing that someone is getting paid a lot for your referral (and they will bother you _a lot_ if you end up getting an offer. They want that check).
